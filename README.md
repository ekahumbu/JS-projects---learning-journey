# JS projects - learning journey to being a JS developer
The repository consists of all mini apps made with HTML, CSS and specifically with JS, in a time span of 30 days ðŸ“†, on my endeavor with Vanilla-JavaScript.The apps are specifically for learning various concepts of Js.
These are JS projects that have been given small touches from me as I build my skills.
Hopefully someone else can learn from them too.
